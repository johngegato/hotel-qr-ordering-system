Here is your complete, consolidated Master AI Prompting Roadmap from Phase 0 through
Phase 5.
Save this document or place it alongside your context.md file in your project root. When you
begin developing each feature in your AI IDE (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, etc.), copy and paste
the prompts sequentially for that specific slice.
🚀 Master AI Prompting Roadmap
📂 Prerequisites: Project File context.md
Create context.md in your project root before executing any prompts:
# Master Project Context: Hospitality SaaS Platform
## Architecture & Tech Stack
- Monorepo structure:
1. `apps/web`: Next.js (React, App Router, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript)
for Guest Web App & Admin Dashboard.
2. `apps/staff-app`: React Native (Expo, TypeScript) for Front Desk
/ Staff Android Tablet App.
3. `packages/supabase`: Shared DB types & migration scripts.
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime WebSockets, Storage).
## Core Principles
- Methodology: Vertical Slice / Feature-Driven Development.
- Multi-Tenancy: All data isolation keyed by `hotel_id` or `room_id`.
- Guest Access: Ephemeral session auth via QR URL parameters
(`room_id` + `qr_auth_hash`).
- TypeScript: Strictly typed interfaces across all apps.
🧱 Phase 0: The Core Skeleton (Foundation)
Prompt 0.1 — Monorepo & App Initialization
"Refer to context.md. Generate the terminal commands and folder structure to set up a
monorepo containing two apps: apps/web (Next.js with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
and apps/staff-app (Expo React Native with TypeScript). Install @supabase/supabase-js in both
applications."
Prompt 0.2 — Supabase Base Multi-Tenant Schema
"Write PostgreSQL scripts for Supabase to set up Phase 0 multi-tenancy:
1. hotels table (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ).
2. rooms table (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, hotel_id FK to hotels, room_number TEXT,
qr_auth_hash TEXT UNIQUE).
3. guest_sessions table (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, room_id FK to rooms, phone_number

TEXT nullable, status TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ, expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ).
4. Seed Data: One hotel ('Grand Hotel') and one room ('Room 302' with hash
'secret-hash-302'). Output raw SQL with basic indexes."
Prompt 0.3 — Guest QR URL Verification Route (Next.js)
"In apps/web, create the route /app/stay/page.tsx. This page should parse URL search
parameters room and hash. Query the Supabase rooms table to verify qr_auth_hash. If valid,
display a simple card: 'Welcome to Room [room_number]! Session Active.' Handle loading and
invalid hash states."
Prompt 0.4 — Staff Tablet Verification Component (Expo)
"In apps/staff-app/App.tsx, write a simple React Native component that connects to Supabase
and queries the hotels count. Display a screen showing 'Front Desk Tablet Interface' with a
green indicator: 'Connected to Supabase' when verified."
📞 Phase 1: The "Call Front Desk" Vertical Slice
Prompt 1.1 — Requests Table Schema
"Write PostgreSQL SQL to create a requests table in Supabase:

● status: TEXT ('PENDING', 'CLAIMED', 'RESOLVED')
● payload: JSONB default {}
● created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ default NOW()
● claimed_at: TIMESTAMPTZ nullable
● claimed_by: UUID nullable Output raw SQL with indexes on hotel_id and status."
Prompt 1.2 — Guest Dual-Action Call Modal (Next.js)
"In apps/web, create a React component CallFrontDeskModal.tsx. Offer two options:
1. 'Call Now' Button: HTML link using href="tel:+1234567890" (pass phone number via
prop).
2. 'Request a Call' Button: Inserts a row into Supabase requests table with request_type:
'CALL_REQUEST' and status: 'PENDING'. Disable the button upon request, start a
3-minute local countdown timer, and show text: 'Notifying Front Desk...'."
Prompt 1.3 — Staff Real-Time Ticket Queue (Expo)
"In apps/staff-app, create a component CallQueue.tsx. Use Supabase Realtime WebSockets to
subscribe to INSERT and UPDATE events on the requests table where request_type =
'CALL_REQUEST' and status = 'PENDING'. Render cards showing: Room Number in large text,
Elapsed time counter, and a 'Claim Request' button that updates status = 'CLAIMED' and

claimed_at = NOW()."
Prompt 1.4 — Real-Time Loop Closure (Guest Side)
"In apps/web, update CallFrontDeskModal.tsx to subscribe via Supabase Realtime WebSockets
